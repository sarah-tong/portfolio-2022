                            |  is a Vancouver-based B2B SaaS startup with a mission to help build a culture of recognition and boost customer loyalty through their rewards and recognition platform. With Guusto, HR leaders, managers, colleagues, and business owners can express real-time appreciation to employees and customers through giving monetary rewards via digital gift cards and non-monetary nominations. Guusto strives to be the modern solution to existing recognition programs by relieving administrative work involved in using physical gift cards.

                    p Shoutouts is a redesign and improvement to Guusto’s past offering, the Nomination Box. The Nomination Box is positioned as a peer-to-peer program where employees can "nominate" or recognize their colleagues for a job well done, usually for reasons that align to company core values. It operates within a closed ecosystem. In other words, employees can only nominate others who are loaded into Guusto as paid Team Members. Shoutouts still supports a peer-to-peer program, but has more flexibility by offering top-down manager-to-employee recognition that goes beyond reinforcing core values as managers may now send a "shoutout" for a special occasion, such as a birthday wish. As well, it is more scalable in that managers may send non-monetary recognition to just about anyone inside and outside the Guusto system and accommodates individuals regardless of their level of access to the internet.

                    p As Guusto primarily serves small to mid-sized businesses with goals to scale up to support enterprise-level needs, its current offering for non-monetary recognition could not fulfill what enterprise clients were looking for. Specifically, 
                        b top-down recognition was key to their recognition culture
                        | . As well, HR leaders could not load everyone as Team Members as it would require knowing their emails to set up accounts within Guusto. 
                        b A large proportion of employees, specifically the blue-collared workforce and contractors, do not have work emails. Others may not have personal emails and may even have limited internet access.
                    
                    br
                    p I was tasked with:
                    
                    ul
                        li How might we support customers who aren’t able to load everyone into Guusto as Team Members but still offer the ability to recognize them?
                        li How might we accommodate employees who don’t have internet to still receive recognition?
                        li How might we allow a manager to recognize an employee for performance that align to company core values but also acknowledge special occasions?
                        
                        
                section
                    h3 Considerations and Constraints
                    
                    p In designing this new feature, the required specs were:
                    
                    ul
                        li the ability to recognize anyone and not be restricted to just Team Members
                        li the flexibility to email or print out recognition
                        li to acknowledge individuals for birthdays, milestones, and other special occasions which aren’t considered company core values
                        li the need to make it flexible and scalable for enterprise needs without jeopardizing current product offerings for existing users.

                    p The peer-to-peer journey is how the Nomination Box operated and worked best for white-collar, smaller workforces where the team size is easily manageable within Guusto. I mapped out a new journey of where we wanted to get to for larger enterprise workforces, being mindful that this feature needed to be accessible without relying on emails.

                    p Positioning involved two considerations: Defining the value proposition and how users will find and navigate to this new form of non-monetary recognition. For this new feature to not compete with our current Nomination Box, it needed to have a clearly defined purpose and be stripped down. Its value proposition was thus defined as a tool that allows managers to send top-down recognition with flexible delivery options, such that it can reach employees with and without access to the internet. It would also only have very simple reporting, as data can only be tracked for Team Members.
                    
                    br
                    p For navigation, some options considered were:
                    
                    div(class="flex-wrapper align-items-center")
                            div(class="col-50")
                                div(class="mockup-dropshadow-container half-img-fig-caption-wrapper")

                            div(class="col-50")
                                p A separate navigation item: Customers can purchase it as a separate item from the Nomination Box and its value proposition can be easily differentiated standing as an independent feature. However, existing customers may flock to this new feature as it’s cheaper whereas we want greater emphasis on the peer-to-peer Nomination Box for these customers to help drive their recognition culture.

                                p Integrated together with the Nomination Box: One form to send recognition but would require making the existing Nomination Box an open ecosystem where a manager can send to any recipient. However, it might add complexity to the existing form and existing customers may reduce the number of paid Team Members.
                    
                    br
                    p After gathering user feedback, the integrated option was preferred. It was simpler for users to do non-monetary recognition in one place. Despite the potential effect of existing customers reducing the number of paid Team Members and making the reporting less robust as data can only be tracked for Team Members, a communication strategy is to inform clients that by adding Team Members, they will gain more comprehensive reporting. Another insight was that it was unclear whether a recipient was a Team Member or non-Team Member. As well, jargon around the Nomination Box and Cheers (intended for acknowledging special occasions) was undefined.

                section
                    p The Nomination Box underwent a redesign overhaul to what is now called Shoutouts. It continues to offer a peer-to-peer recognition program where an employee may "nominate" or recognize their colleague for a job well done or congratulate them for a special occasion. It also offers Managers the ability to recognize or celebrate just about anyone regardless of what level of internet access they may have.

There are a number of visual cues to help differentiate the two types of recipients a manager may send to. As well, when recognizing non-Team Members, a bar appears to inform whose data is tracked.

                    p Recognizing someone for a core reason and celebrating someone for a special occasion is differentiated through icons that permeate not only in the dropdown selection, but in the recent activity, as well as the leaderboard. The shoutout preview also changes depending on which of the two reason types are selected.  When “Include Celebrations” is toggled on, the count for any shoutouts with celebration reasons will be added on top of the core value numbers. A dedicated leaderboard for celebration reasons is not offered as improving employee performance, engagement, and retention should be driven by reinforcing company core values.

                    p The main challenge encountered was the potential cannibalization of the current Nomination Box feature by offering a “lite” and cheaper version as customers wouldn’t need to pay per Team Member. In light of  iterations and user feedback, the solution to merge it into one non-monetary program will hopefully mean capturing a bigger share of the market of differing needs that the niche peer-to-peer Nomination Box couldn’t fulfill previously. While this feature has not yet been released, we hope to see greater adoption of our non-monetary recognition offering and more sending activity as some of the measures for success.

                section
                    p Redesigning the platform is a daunting yet exhilarating endeavour, especially when I began as a team of 1. While I enjoy having accountability and ownership over product direction, what came with it was learning how to balance multiple stakeholder’s needs and interests. There were prospective customers looking for features, new customers signing large contracts and making their requests, existing customers to retain, a product roadmap to address, Engineering time to respect, departmental feedback, my own convictions in good design principles, and more recently, emphasizing with my intern and helping them navigate ambiguity and tradeoffs. Simultaneously, it is invigorating to distill the problem and abstractions, entertain and abandon possibilities, and put it together and present a concrete vision. Working at a start-up has been truly eye-opening as it has amplified ambiguity and the need to embrace the bigger picture. You could say I appreciate Guusto.
